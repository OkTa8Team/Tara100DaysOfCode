# Tara100DaysOfCode

Rules for 100 days of code are simple:

  1. Writing  code every single day
  2. All code must be written before midnight
  3. Code must be up on GitHub
  4. Written code must be useful (comments, reformatting, refactoring does not count)
  5. Written code canâ€™t be related to work, must be created in spare time, after hours (probably during nights, a day has only 24 hours)
